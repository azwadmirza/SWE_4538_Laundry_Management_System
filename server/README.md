# SWE 4538 Laundry Management System
A dev ops based approach to complete the server programming project for SWE 4538.
The core functionalities that this project requires are as follows:
1. Basic Authentication - This includes creating functionalities for user sign-up, as well as
enabling user sign-in for authenticated access. Additionally, you should implement
mechanisms for users to reset their forgotten passwords. Finally, incorporate a logout
feature, ensuring users can securely end their sessions when needed.
2. Google OAuth - This authentication method will allow users to securely log in using their
Google credentials.
3. Basic CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations in a database- Each of
these operations should have a minimum of 10 requests to showcase their functionality
thoroughly. Additionally, it's important to include query strings and parameters in the
request formats to demonstrate versatility and flexibility in handling data. If necessary,
feel free to create additional requests beyond the minimum to provide a comprehensive
overview of your backend's capabilities. You can use any database of your choice.
4. File Handling - You need to deal with various types of files, such as images, audio, and
video. Your task is to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for
these files. To demonstrate your proficiency, you should aim to incorporate at least two
different types of file-handling techniques into your backend solution.
5. Handling Form Data - Take user requests through form data and handle them
accordingly.
